I will be creating a basic recpie website. I will be using basic HTML5 code to do so. Such as, adding a boilerplate, using links and images, as well as using the correct form of headings.

I added basic CSS to stylize my webpage. I exercised the use of descendant combinators, while implenting the proper use of ID vs class.
